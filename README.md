## Generating branch metrics data

Dummy metrics data can be generated by running the "generate_branch_metrics.py" file. The file has several inputs that it can take to customize the data, see the example below for details and instructions. 

generate_branch_metrics.py -i 60 -p 86400 -s 0 -f 2 -b 5

These are the default values for the program, explained from left to right: 
 - -i / --increment: The increment that each metric value is returned for, eg. if set to 60 then the timestamps will increment in values of 60 (0, 60, 120, ...)
 - -p / --period: The total length of time the file is returned for in seconds, defaults to one day at 86400 seconds 
 - -s / --start_timestamp: The start timestamp, eg. the first timestamp that appears in the file 
 - -f / --frequency: A scaling value that increases / decreases how often the values will spike 
 - -b / --branch_count: The total number of branches that will be returned
